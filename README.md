# Email-Validation-Script

Overview:-
This script is a simple email validation tool written in Python. It performs several checks to ensure that the input email address conforms to basic email format rules.

Features:-
1) Checks if the email is at least 6 characters long.
2) Verifies that the email starts with an alphanumeric character.
3) Ensures there is exactly one '@' character in the email.
4) Validates that the email has a period ('.') in the correct position (either the third-to-last or fourth-to-last character).
5) Ensures that the email does not contain any whitespace characters or invalid symbols.
6) Differentiates between uppercase and lowercase letters in the email.
